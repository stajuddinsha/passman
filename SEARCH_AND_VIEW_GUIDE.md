# Search and View Guide

## ✅ **SUCCESS: Load All Entries and Search Functionality!**

The application now loads all existing entries by default and provides search functionality!

### 🎯 **What's Working**

1. **✅ Load All Entries** - Shows all entries when application starts
2. **✅ Search Functionality** - Filters entries based on search query
3. **✅ Real-time Search** - Updates results as you type
4. **✅ Show All on Empty Search** - Shows all entries when search is cleared

### 🧪 **How to Test**

#### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
./target/release/keytui-gui
```

#### Step 2: View All Entries
- **All entries should be visible** in the main list
- **Status shows** "Showing X entries" at the bottom
- **Sample entries** (Gmail, GitHub) should be displayed

#### Step 3: Test Search Functionality
1. **Type in the search field** (e.g., "gmail")
2. **Results should filter** to show only matching entries
3. **Status updates** to show "Found X results for 'gmail'"
4. **Clear the search** - all entries should reappear

#### Step 4: Add New Entries
1. **Click the "➕ Add" button**
2. **Fill out the dialog** with Name and Password
